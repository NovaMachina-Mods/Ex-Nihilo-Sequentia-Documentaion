## Formatting
Use markdown formatting on all files. If you need to add a new page be sure to add it to the `mkdocs.yml` file.

Use spaces to indent instead of tabs.

All links should have their location specified at the bottom of the page. Internal links should all be relative.

If you need help understanding formatting, check out the source files of any of the current pages.
