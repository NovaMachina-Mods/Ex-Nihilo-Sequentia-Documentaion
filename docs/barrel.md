# Barrel

The barrel has a wide range of uses. You can use it to compost organics into dirt, transform one fluid into another, transform a fluid into a block with an item, and spawn mobs. When in the rain, the barrel will collect water. Right click the barrel to get a block out of the barrel. Right click the barrel with a bucket to add or remove a fluid.

Wood barrels cannot accept hot fluids. Stone barrels can accept hot fluids. Water has a temperature of 300. Anything over 433 will not go into a wood barrel.

!!! Warning
    Once a compost item is in the barrel, it cannot be removed. A barrel will void any fluid in it when it is broken.
