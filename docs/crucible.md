Crucible
========
The crucible is used to melt various blocks and items into fluids. Right click the barrel to place an item or block into the crucible. Place a heat source under the barrel to begin the melting process. Once a crucible is full, right click with a bucket to add or remove a fluid.

The Fired Crucible can be used to melt down everything that the Wooden Crucible can, however, not everything that the Fired Crucible melts down can be melted by the wooden crucible.

!!! Note
    An Unfired Crucible *MUST* be smelted to be used.

!!! Warning
    Once an item is in the crucible, it cannot be removed. A crucible will void any fluid in it when it is broken.
